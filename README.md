# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I started the project to increase my knowledge on git/commands and github. I never made a site before on github. It has helped me with various skills such as understanding the repetitive git commands and what I am doing; also adding notes to myself on the site for future use. The notes included; javascript, HTML, CSS and Git begineer tips. A useful lesson I learned from the project was making sure 100% what you are adding to the site before you upload anything including branches.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
This site can be used to educate begineers on web development basics and tips that will help you to build a website. If you open up the console if you have devtools installed (chrome has them automatically) you can see the javascript coding inside. It will tell you which category to study first!
